## 🚨 Critical Rules (Never Break These)

1. **Git Workflow:**
   - Pull BEFORE making changes: `git pull origin main --no-rebase`
   - Push AFTER committing: `git push origin main`

2. **Database:**
   - ONLY use Supabase (not Neon, not local)
   - ALL clients need: `db: { schema: 'menuca_v3' }`
   - NEVER hardcode schema in queries

3. **Schema:**
   - Dishes: prices in `dish_prices` table (NOT in dishes table)
   - Modifiers: prices in `dish_modifier_prices` table (may not exist = free)
   - Restaurants: NO `slug` column (extract ID from slug)

4. **Before Any Database Work:**
   - Check if column exists
   - Check if table exists
   - Verify with Supabase MCP if unsure
