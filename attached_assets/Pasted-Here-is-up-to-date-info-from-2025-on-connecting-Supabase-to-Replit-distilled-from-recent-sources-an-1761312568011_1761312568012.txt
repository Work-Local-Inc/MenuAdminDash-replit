Here is up-to-date info from 2025 on connecting Supabase to Replit, distilled from recent sources and a March 2025 video tutorial:

Steps to connect Supabase to Replit (2025):

1. In Supabase:

Go to Authentication > Sign Up Configuration and, for development only, turn off confirm email.

Under Connect > Connection info:

Copy your Supabase URL and anon/public key.

For ORMs, use the shared connection pooler URL (drizzle for JS, with your password and schema).

Change the app framework to React (if that fits your stack) and copy connection details.

2. In Replit:

Go to the Secrets manager.

Add these environment variables:

SUPABASE_CONNECTION_STRING: (from Supabase)

SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: (from Supabase)

SUPABASE_URL: (from Supabase)

Paste the relevant keys and URLs but NOT the secret values into your source code.

3. In your code:

For React/JS:

javascript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);
Configure sign-ins with Supabase Auth (e.g., email/password, Google, etc.).

Example for Google Sign-In:

javascript
const { error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google' });
For troubleshooting, make sure redirect URIs in Supabase match your Replit web app’s domain.

4. Troubleshooting tips (2025):

If login flow fails, double-check the variables and prompts you pass to Replit Agent/AI.

Try restarting the process in a fresh chat if you encounter environment handling bugs.

For advanced setups (e.g., user sign-in), ask the agent step-by-step and feed it each secret so it doesn’t get confused.

You may have to re-send secrets/variables if Replit asks again; provide values only through Secrets, NOT in the code directly.

5. Real world notes from 2025:

This workflow is now common; the integration typically succeeds after a few minutes of setup for most users, but login features may need several tries or troubleshooting.

The AI agent in Replit can now automate connecting these services, but manual step-by-step (with careful secrets handling) is still the fallback.​
