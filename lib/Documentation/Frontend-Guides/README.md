# Frontend Developer Guides

**Purpose:** Santiago's "Source of Truth" - how to build features using the backend

**When to use:**
- **Always** before implementing a new feature
- To find available SQL functions and Edge Functions
- To understand the backend architecture
- To see example code patterns

## Structure

```
Frontend-Guides/
├── BRIAN_MASTER_INDEX.md          # Start here! Index of all entities
├── Restaurant Management/          # 50+ SQL functions, 29 Edge functions
├── Users-&-Access/                # Auth, RBAC, admin management
└── [Other entity folders...]      # Menu, Orders, Promotions, etc.
```

## For AI Agents

1. **Start with BRIAN_MASTER_INDEX.md** - See all available entities
2. **Find your entity folder** - Restaurant Management, Users & Access, etc.
3. **Read the Frontend Guide** - Understand available functions
4. **Copy example code** - Santiago provides working examples
5. **Check Audit-Reports** - See if there are known issues

## Key Principle

These guides show **what Santiago built** (the backend).  
The Audit-Reports show **what we actually implemented** (may differ due to bugs).

Always check both!
